# The game of Nim - Multi-agent implementation

This is a project made for the Multiagent Systems course during my third semester of the Master's program at Faculty of Organization and Informatics.
What's described in this project is a simple 2-agent system in which both agents try to best each other at the game of Nim.
An agent has 2 modes of playing. The first mode includes making random moves, while the other mode includes making moves by calculating the so-called NimSum.
